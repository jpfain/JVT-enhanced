      <h4>What Is Time?</h4>
      <p>What is time? The Bible speaks of time as a reality but gives no definition. For centuries, man has unsuccessfully attempted to define it. Although time is universally accepted, no one can definitively say what it is. Scientists have proposed countless theories. However, the late Albert Einstein once said that “time is the distance between two events.” To be continued ….</p>

      <h4>How Time Flows</h4>
      <p>Although we cannot define it, time has certain characteristics that we do understand. For example, the so‑called “stream of time” is always moving forward, like a river flowing in one direction. And its “rate of flow” can be measured by events, i.e., the clicking of a clock, the orbit of the earth, and so on.</p>

      <h4>Jehovah’s View of Time</h4>
      <p>Our Creator, Jehovah God, lives in an eternity of time, having no beginning. Therefore, His view of time is quite different from our human perspective. The Scriptures tell us that “one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.” (2 Peter 3:8)</p>

      <h4>Our Changing Perspective</h4>
      <p>How is that possible? Have you noticed that time seems to go by much faster as you get older? Think about summer vacation from school when you were young: June through August felt like a lifetime before you had to return. But now, if you are up in years, three months seems very short.</p>

      <h4>An Illustration</h4>
      <p>Consider “one year” as a unit of time:</p>
      <p>If you were one year old and add one year to your life, you have doubled your lifespan — a 100% increase.</p>
      <p>If you were 50 years old and add one year to your life, you have added 2% to your lifespan.</p>
      <p>If you were 1,000 years old and add one year to your life, you have increased your lifespan by 0.1%.</p>

      <h4>The Point</h4>
      <p>The point is: as we live longer, our perspective of time changes, and a given unit of time appears smaller and less significant. To our Creator, who has always existed, 1,000 years could easily feel like one day.</p>
