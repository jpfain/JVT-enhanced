      <h3 id="infoTitle">Time Explained</h3>
      <h4>What Is Time?</h4>
      <p>What is time? The Bible speaks of time as a reality but does not define it. For centuries, humans have tried unsuccessfully to explain it. Although time is universally accepted, no one can definitively say what it is. Scientists have proposed countless theories. The late Albert Einstein once described time as “the distance between two events.”</p>

      <h4>How Time Flows</h4>
      <p>Even if we cannot fully define it, time has characteristics we can observe. For example, the so‑called “stream of time” is always moving forward, like a river flowing in one direction. Its “rate of flow” can be measured by events, such as the rising of the sun, the orbit of the earth, or the ticking of a clock.</p>

      <h4>Jehovah’s View of Time</h4>
      <p>Our Creator, Jehovah God, lives in an eternity of time, having no beginning. His view of time is therefore very different from our human perspective. The Scriptures tell us that “one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.” (2 Peter 3:8)</p>

      <h4>Our Changing Perspective</h4>
      <p>How can that be? You’ve likely noticed that time seems to go by much faster as you get older. Think about summer vacation from school when you were young: June through August felt like a lifetime before you had to return to school. But as an older adult, three months seems very short.</p>

      <h4>To Illustrate</h4>
      <p>Consider “one year” as a unit of time:</p>
      <p>If you were one year old and added “one year” to your life, you would double your lifespan — a 100% increase.</p>
      <p>If you were 50 years old and added one year to your life, you would add 2% to your lifespan.</p>
      <p>If you were 1,000 years old and added one year to your life, you would increase your lifespan by only 0.1%.</p>

      <h4>The Point</h4>
      <p>The point is this: as we live longer, our perspective of time changes, and a given unit of time appears smaller and less significant. To our Creator, who has always existed, 1,000 years could easily feel like a single day.</p>

      <h4>Why It Matters to Us</h4>
      <p>As we begin to see and appreciate Jehovah’s perspective of time, it becomes easier to understand his way of dealing with us.</p>

      <p>For example, many people wonder: “Why has God allowed human suffering to continue for thousands of years?” “Why is he so slow to act?” Adam was created in 4026&nbsp;BCE; that is over 6,000 years ago — a very long time from our standpoint.</p>

      <p>But how long has it been in Jehovah’s eyes? Enter “4026&nbsp;BCE” in the BCE/CE Years Calculator to find out. From Jehovah’s perspective, he could rightly say, “Just give me to the end of the week, and I will make all things new.”</p>
      <p>Jehovah is not unsympathetic. He understands that our perspective of time differs from his, and he is not “slow concerning his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is <strong>patient</strong> with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:8, 9)</p>
